Please contribute if you feel that something can be improved!

## Installation
Clone the project or just download and install `UserPainCalculator.crx` in Chrome (Settings > Extensions) to use the extension. Google's got [some help](http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=187443) on the matter too.
